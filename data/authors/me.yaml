bio: |
  Hi, I am a Master student in the Department of Institute of Evolution & Marine Biodiversity at Ocean University of China, advised by Prof. Jin SUN. Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. degree from Hainan University in 2024. My research interests lie broadly in Bioinformatics, with a specific focus on Genomics and multi-omics. I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at honghaozhao.bio@gmail.com.
